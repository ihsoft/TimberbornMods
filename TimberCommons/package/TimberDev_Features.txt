# Indicates that duration in the "supply lasts for" message on GoodConsumingBuilding UI should be
# formatted as "Xd Yh" instead of "XX hours".
GoodConsumingBuildingUI.DaysHoursViewForAllBuildings

# Indicates that durations for the growth time for all growables should be formatted as "Xd Yh" instead of rounding
# to days.
GrowableGrowthTimeUI.DaysHoursViewForAllGrowables

# Indicates whether recipe durations exceeding 24 hours should be displayed in days/hours format.
RecipesUI.ShowDaysHoursForSlowRecipes

# Specifies whether fuel rates below 0.1 should be displayed with increased precision in the recipe UI.
RecipesUI.ShowLongValueForLowFuelConsumptionRecipes

# Specifies whether the terrain view should be adjusted to present irrigated tiles as "well moisturized". Otherwise,
# the stock logic will decide based on the moisture level.
WaterTowers.OverrideDesertLevels

# Specifies whether no UI changes to the stock logic must be made by the mod.
# It's a super setting to any UI affecting Harmony patches. If the game doesn't work well or the mod doesn't load,
# enable this feature and only the stock UI will be in action.
!CommonUI.DisableAllPatches

# Specifies whether beavers that move underground should be checked for badwater exposure.
# The stock game doesn't allow beavers to be underground, but there are mods that provide underground buildings like

CommonQoL.NoContaminationUnderground

# Specifies whether GPU simulator controls shown be show on the panel.

# Specifies whether multi-threaded simulator controls shown be show on the panel.
!Physics.ShowMultiThreadedSimulatorsPanel

# Specifies whether haulers and builders should satisfy their needs in priority.
# Normally, beavers go to the storage that is closest to their housing location. With this option enabled, 
# they will pick the closest storage relative to their current position that can satisfy hunger or thirst need. The
# food type need will be disregarded, which may impact the overall wellbeing score. 
HaulersAndBuilders.EnableOptimization

# Specifies the minimum delta between the best and the alternative paths to the food supply to consider.
# In terms of wellbeing, the alternative is always a worse choice, but it's closer to the beaver, so the need can be
# satisfied quicker. This setting specifies the minimum benefit in the travel time that must be achieved for the
# alternative choice to be accepted. The value is in hours of travel.
