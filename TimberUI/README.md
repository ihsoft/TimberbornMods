# Timberborn: TimberUI tools

A mod that allows exporting various Timberborn visual assets. These assets can be used
to learn how the game's controls are made and/or re-use them when creating UI for the own Timberborn mods.

## Overview

The most important parts you would need are: the common stylesheets and the generic visual assets.

Common stylesheets:
* `UI/Views/Common/CommonStyle`
* `UI/Views/Core/CoreStyle`

Entity panel fragments stylesheets (if you make a custom interface for the building):
* `UI/Views/Game/EntityPanel/EntityPanelGameStyle`
* `UI/Views/Common/EntityPanel/EntityPanelCommonStyle`

Generic visual assets:
* `UI/Views/Core/PreciseSlider`
* `UI/Views/Core/Dropdown`

You may discover other cases, which you would like to at least see how they were made.
