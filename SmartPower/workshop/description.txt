[h1]Overview[/h1]
This mod modifies some power generating and consuming buildings to optimize power usage. It also adds some UI sugar to the existing components.

[h1]Ironteeth Engine[/h1]
[list]
[*] Engines automatically turn on and off to minimize the wood consumption while providing enough power supply to the network.
[*] If there are batteries in the network, then the engines will only produce energy to keep the total network charge reserve within a specified range. For example, "not less than 10%, but not greater than 35%." This can be configured per engine.
[/list]

[h1]Power Wheel[/h1]
[list]
[*] If automation is turned on for the wheel, it will pause and resume based on the demand/supply.
[*] The same approach to battery charging applies as for the Engine. Engine and Power Wheel settings aren't shared.
[/list]
Wheels differ slightly from Engines in terms of how they compensate for supply shortages. It may take a significant amount of time before an unpaused wheel starts producing energy. Therefore, when a shortage is detected, all the wheels in the network will start. Then, some of them that are not needed will pause.

[h1]Ironteeth bot charging station[/h1]
The charging station consumes full power only when charging a bot. In the idle state, it is only taking 1 hp.

[h1]Powered attractions[/h1]
If an attraction needs energy, but has no attendees, then it will go into low power mode and only consumes 1 hp.

[h1]Powered manufactories[/h1]
If a manufactory has assigned worker, but the product can't be produced for any reason, then the building goes into power-saving mode in which it only consumes 10% of the nominal power. Buildings in this mode will have a special notification icon and an explanation of why the mode was activated. Also, if no recipe selected, the building doesn't consume power at all.

[h1]Mechanical nodes[/h1]
All buildings with a mechanical node like shafts or generators get a UI extension. They will show information about batteries in the network: the remaining charge, charge/discharge rate, and the remaining time estimation.
